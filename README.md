# Misc Scripts

This repository contains a collection of **Python** and **Shell** scripts designed to run locally from the terminal.  
The scripts cover multiple use cases such as:

- PC Security monitoring (connections, processes, logs)  
- Job scraping & career research  
- General daily automation tasks 

All scripts are lightweight and run **locally** without external dependencies (unless otherwise noted).
